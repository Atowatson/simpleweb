					<p><h1><CENTER style="font-size: larger; color: #A2C033;">ADVANTAGES</center><br></h1><b>COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION</b><br><br>
Parks are complex elements of a city. They can serve scores of different uses, may be specialized in their function, or can simply provide visual appeal for residents. However they work, they act to define the shape and feel of a city and its neighborhoods. They also function as a conscious tool  for revitalization.<div><center><img src="images/co.jpg" width= "400" height="200" alt></center></div></p>  
				  <p><b>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</b><br><br>
Parks provide intrinsic environmental, aesthetic, and recreation benefits to our cities. They are also a source of positive economic benefits. They enhance property values, increase municipal revenue, bring in homebuyers and workers, and attract retirees. <div><center><img src="images/ed.jpg" width= "400" height="200" alt></center></div></p>
                    <p><b>CREATE SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS</b><br><br>
For those concerned that green spaces may foster crime and illegal activity, evidence now exists that the opposite may be true. When adjacent to residential areas, green spaces have been shown to create neighborhoods with fewer violent and property crimes and where neighbors tend to support and protect one another. The factors that explain these findings emphasize the importance of greenery in community and personal wellness. <div><center><img src="images/sn.jpg" width= "300" height="200" alt></center></div>
                  </p>
        <p><b>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</b><br><br>

Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with individuals and groups to achieve specific goals. For parks and open spaces, community engagement allows mayors and public officials to directly involve their constituencies in the ongoing design, planning and management of these resources. This process results in informed and engaged residents that feel better connected to their communities. While sometimes contentious, but more often productive and rewarding, community engagement is an essential ingredient of making successful urban open space<div><center><img src="images/ce.jpg" width= "600" height="200" alt></center></div>
                        .</p>
      <p><b>HELP CHILDREN LEARN</b><br><br>


Childhood is a holistic process, different for each individual child. Many children do not learn effectively exclusively within a classroom. They need alternative, hands-on learning environments to match their varied learning styles. Parks can help.<div><center><img src="images/l.jpg" width= "400" height="200" alt></center></div>
                  </p>
     <p><b>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</b><br><br>


Just as growing communities need to upgrade and expand their built infrastructure of roads, sewers, and utilities, they also need to upgrade and expand their green infrastructure, the interconnected system of green spaces that conserves natural ecosystem values and functions, sustains clear air and water, and provides a wide array of benefits to people and wildlife. Green infrastructure is a community's natural life support system, the ecological framework needed for environmental and economic sustainability.<div><center><img src="images/gi.jpg" width= "400" height="200" alt></center></div>

                  </p>
  

 <p><b>PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH</b><br><br>



People value the time they spend in city parks, whether walking a dog, playing basketball, or having a picnic. Along with these expected leisure amenities, parks can also provide measurable health benefits, from providing direct contact with nature and a cleaner environment, to opportunities for physical activity and social interaction. A telephone survey conducted for the American Public Health Association found that 75 percent of adults believe parks and recreation must play an important role in addressing America's obesity crisis<div><center><img src="images/ph.jpg" width= "500" height="300" alt></center></div>
