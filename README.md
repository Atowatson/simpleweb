/*Due to the current economic crisis, many City Officials are forced to reduce some of the social services they offered to their communities. Parks and recreation services are mostly targeted.

Design a web page to list and discuss the advantages of having park and recreation services available in our cities and the roles they play in our lives.

Design a second web page to convince your City Officials of the necessity of continuing providing their communities with park and recreation services.

Design a template of this second page to allow others to help you disseminate your cause.
Include images and external links in both pages to reinforce each of your arguments. Design navigation which allows your audience to peruse back and fourth throughout your website. Use containers to organize your page contents. Upload all 3 pages to a remote site of your choice and submit the address.*/
